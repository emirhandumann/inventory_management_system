# Akdeniz Pharmaceutical Warehouse (APW)

## Introduction
Akdeniz Pharmaceutical Warehouse (APW) is a software solution designed to optimize inventory management for pharmacies and a central pharmaceutical warehouse. It enables efficient stock tracking, automated alerts, and streamlined communication between pharmacies and the warehouse.

## Features

### Central Warehouse Functionalities:
- **Add Product**: Add new medications to the inventory.
- **Update Stock**: Modify stock levels for existing medications.
- **List Products**: Display all medications with details such as stock levels and expiration dates.
- **Remove Product**: Remove discontinued or unused medications.
- **Stock by Category**: Organize and view medications by categories.
- **Stock by Product**: Search for and view details of specific medications.
- **Expiring Products**: Highlight medications nearing expiration.

### Pharmacy Functionalities:
- **Check Stock**: View up-to-date stock levels.
- **Order Product**: Place restocking orders directly to the warehouse.
- **Track Product**: Monitor the status of ordered medications.

## Design Patterns Used
1. **Composite Pattern**:
   - Organizes medications into hierarchical categories (e.g., "Antibiotics," "Pain Relievers").
   - Simplifies inventory navigation and management.

2. **Observer Pattern**:
   - Ensures real-time notifications for stock changes.
   - Keeps pharmacies and the warehouse synchronized on stock levels.

3. **Singleton Pattern**:
   - Maintains a single instance for critical components like the inventory database.
   - Prevents duplicate data and ensures consistency across the system.
